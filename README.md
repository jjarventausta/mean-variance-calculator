# mean-variance-calculator

From the Self-study package for Python, i chose to do the 1st one: Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator.
In this repository i have added my solution to it into mean-variance-calculator.py file. I first did the solution in the FreeCodeCamp's gitpod to get the URL to check the solution. And for the repository i chose to add my solution into GitHub to link to the assignment return.
